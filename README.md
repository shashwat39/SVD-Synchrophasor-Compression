# Synchrophasor Data Compression with SVD and Real-Time Partitioning

This repository implements a method for compressing synchrophasor data using singular value decomposition (SVD) and real-time partitioning algorithms. Synchrophasor data, generated by phasor measurement units (PMUs) in power systems, is compressed to improve storage and processing efficiency while maintaining data integrity.

## Description

The rise of PMUs has led to an exponential growth in synchrophasor data, posing challenges in data management and analysis. This project proposes a compression technique based on SVD, which evaluates data dimensions to reduce them while considering measurement uncertainties and signal-to-noise ratio (SNR). It prioritizes high-SNR modes and excludes error-affected ones, ensuring critical information retention during compression.

Additionally, a real-time partitioning algorithm is implemented to segregate data into normal and disturbance conditions. This approach enhances accuracy and compression ratio (CR), essential for managing large-scale synchrophasor datasets in power system applications.
